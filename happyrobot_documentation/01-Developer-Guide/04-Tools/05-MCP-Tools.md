# MCP Tools

> Import tools from external Model Context Protocol servers into your workflows

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools let you import functions from external MCP servers and use them as tools in your voice and text agents. Instead of building a custom tool with child action nodes, you connect to an MCP server that already exposes the capabilities you need.

## How MCP tools work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect an MCP server">
    Add your MCP server as a credential in the [Integrations](../15-Integrations/01-Integrations-Overview.md) section. See [MCP Server Setup](06-MCP-Server-Setup.md) for details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Discover tools">
    The platform connects to your server, fetches its tool list, and displays them in the MCP Server tools tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to a workflow">
    In the workflow editor, add a tool to a prompt node and select an MCP tool from the discovered tools list. The platform creates a tool node linked to a child **MCP Call** action node automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure behavior">
    Customize the message type, hold music, and how each parameter gets its value. The tool description and parameter structure are read-only — they come from the MCP server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What you can configure

When an MCP tool is added to a workflow, some fields are set by the server and some are editable:

| Field                                 | Source     | Editable                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Description**                       | MCP server | No — displayed as read-only text.                                                                |
| **Parameter names and types**         | MCP server | No — structure is fixed by the server.                                                           |
| **How each parameter is filled**      | You        | Yes — **Agent decides** or **Fixed value**. See below.                                           |
| **Parameter test values**             | You        | Yes — enter example values for testing (agent-filled parameters only).                           |
| **Tool arguments**                    | You        | Yes — override or supply default values for each parameter; editor adapts to the parameter type. |
| **Message type and content**          | You        | Yes — choose AI, Fixed, or None.                                                                 |
| **Hold music**                        | You        | Yes — select from built-in or custom audio.                                                      |
| **Custom headers**                    | You        | Yes — define HTTP headers sent with every MCP tool call.                                         |
| **Environment for schema generation** | You        | Yes — choose which environment the node's schema-generation test runs against.                   |

### Agent-filled and fixed parameters

Every parameter in the tool node's **Parameters** section has a dropdown that decides where its value comes from:

| Mode                        | Behavior                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent decides** (default) | The agent fills the parameter from the conversation. The test value you enter is exposed as a variable to child nodes.                                      |
| **Fixed value**             | The value you configure is sent to the MCP server exactly as written, on every call. The parameter is hidden from the agent, so the agent never chooses it. |

A fixed value supports [variables](../02-Workflows/07-Variables.md) — type `@` to reference workflow data — so you can pin a parameter to a trigger field, an [environment variable](../16-Account-and-Settings/08-Environment-Variables.md), or a literal.

Pin a parameter when the value belongs to the workflow rather than the conversation: a tenant or account identifier, a fixed page size, a region, or a flag the agent shouldn't be able to change.

<Warning>
  A required parameter set to **Fixed value** but left blank blocks publishing. The node reports `Fixed value required for: <parameter>` until you fill it in or hand the parameter back to the agent — otherwise it would be both hidden from the agent and missing from the call, and the MCP server would reject the request at run time.
</Warning>

### Tool argument types

The tool argument editor on the MCP Call node adapts to the type each parameter declares on the MCP server:

| Parameter type                | Editor                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`, `number`, `boolean` | A single templated text input. Type `@` to insert workflow variables.                                                |
| `array`                       | A list editor — add or remove items with **Add value**. Each item supports variables.                                |
| `object`                      | A templated text input expecting a JSON object (e.g., `{"key":"value"}`). Variables can be embedded inside the JSON. |

### Custom headers

The MCP Call action node supports custom HTTP headers. Use this to pass authentication tokens, tenant identifiers, or other metadata that your MCP server needs on each request.

Add key-value pairs in the **Custom Headers** section of the MCP Call node configuration. Both keys and values support variable templating — type `@` to insert workflow variables into a header value.

Use custom headers to forward context from the workflow to the MCP server, such as a customer ID, session token, or any per-call metadata the server needs to process the request.

For example, to forward a session token from your workflow:

| Key               | Value                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| `X-Session-Token` | `@trigger.session_token` |
| `X-Tenant-ID`     | `acme-corp`              |

### Environment for schema generation

Generating an MCP Call node's output schema means calling the MCP server, and which server you reach depends on the [environment](../02-Workflows/09-Environments.md) the test runs in. By default every node in a workflow generates schemas against the environment set on the trigger node, falling back to **Development** when the trigger has none.

The MCP Call node has its own **Environment for schema generation** selector to override that:

| Option                                       | Behavior                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default**                                  | Use the workflow's testing environment, or **Development** if it isn't set.                                                                              |
| **Development**, **Staging**, **Production** | Generate the schema against that environment's credentials and [environment variables](../16-Account-and-Settings/08-Environment-Variables.md), whatever the trigger is set to. |

Use this when the MCP server you want to introspect lives in a different environment than the rest of the workflow's test run — for example, a staging server whose tool list is ahead of production, or a server whose URL or token differs per environment.

The selector affects schema generation only. At runtime the node always uses the environment the run executes in.

## MCP tool architecture

When you add an MCP tool to a prompt node, the platform creates two linked nodes:

1. **Tool node** — contains the tool description, parameters, and message configuration.
2. **MCP Call action node** — a child node that handles the actual call to the MCP server at runtime.

<Warning>
  Do not delete the child MCP Call action node independently. It is required for the tool to function. If you need to remove an MCP tool, delete the parent tool node — the child node will be removed automatically.
</Warning>

### Copying MCP tools

The pair travels together on the clipboard. Select an MCP tool node **and** its child MCP Call node to copy them; copying the tool node alone is rejected, because the pasted tool would have nothing to call. The MCP Call node can't be copied on its own either.

## Example

An MCP server at your company exposes a `find_carriers` tool that searches for available carriers by lane and equipment type.

1. Connect the MCP server in Integrations with the server URL and authentication credentials.
2. The platform discovers `find_carriers` with parameters: `origin` (string), `destination` (string), `equipment_type` (string).
3. Add the `find_carriers` MCP tool to your voice agent's prompt node.
4. Set message type to **AI** with the guidance: "Tell the caller you're searching for available carriers."
5. Set hold music to **Acoustic**.

During a call, when the caller asks about carrier availability, the agent calls `find_carriers` with the extracted parameters, the MCP server returns results, and the agent relays them to the caller.
