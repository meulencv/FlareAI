# Delete a node

> Deletes the specified node. For tool, condition, and paths-root nodes, owned child nodes are also cascade-deleted. For action, prompt, and module-change nodes, children are reparented to the deleted node's parent so the workflow chain is preserved. Agent nodes delete their internal children (prompt + tools) while reparenting downstream workflow nodes. The trigger node (root node with no parent) cannot be deleted.

        Deletes the specified node. For tool, condition, and paths-root nodes,
        owned child nodes are also cascade-deleted. For action, prompt, and
        module-change nodes, children are reparented to the deleted node's
        parent so the workflow chain is preserved. Agent nodes delete their
        internal children (prompt + tools) while reparenting downstream workflow
        nodes. The trigger node (root node with no parent) cannot be deleted.
